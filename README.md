##Project Overview
This repository contains my **individual assignment** on **performance testing**.  
The purpose of this assignment is to analyze system behavior under different load conditions using:

- Load Testing  
- Stress Testing  
- Spike Testing  

The results are documented through test reports and screenshots.

##  Types of Tests Conducted

### 1. Load Test
- Simulates normal expected user traffic.
- Measures system performance under typical usage.
- Screenshot: `Load Test.jpg`

### 2. Stress Test
- Pushes the system beyond its normal capacity.
- Identifies system breaking points and stability.

### 3. Spike Test
- Introduces sudden increases in traffic.
- Observes system response and recovery.
